# WORK STUFF:

## Profi-Tour
For Profi-Tour things, look in the documentation folder.

## NEEDS TO BE ADDED:
- Fix Profi-Tour Documentation -> Make it useful for other Humans
- Script that re-names all Frachtbriefe & Tourenplan .PDF files in the correct way and pushes them to the right locations.
- Native-Windows-Contextmenu-Stuff for making lists of wrongly calculated things from "$HERSTELLER".
- Automations to "GREP" things from PDFs to make a list of items with their build times.
- Probably make everything work in Powershell or BATCH [PUKE] - People refusing me LINUX again :((
 
## WORKING: (Still needs adoption for "$Hersteller")
### ANTI-BORING-SCRIPT: (Better Name -> Time_Calc.sh)
Executes One of Two basic Python-Script for extracting data out of a .pdf or a Screenshot file and calculating times per item + total time.

- It reads item number + item name and accepts a list of build times for different items and multiplies them.

### Terminal Output:
