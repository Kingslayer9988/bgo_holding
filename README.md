WORK STUFF:

NEEDS TO BE ADDED:
-> Script that re-names all Frachtbriefe & Tourenplan .PDF Files in the Correct Way and pushes them to right locations
-> Native-Windows-Contextmenu-Stuff for making Lists of worng calculated things from "$HERSTELLER"
-> Automations for to "GREP" things from PDFS to make a List of Items with their buildtimes.
==> Probably make everything work in Powershell oder BATCH [PUKE] - People refusing me LINUX again :((
 

WORKING: (Still needs Adoption for "$Hersteller") 
ANTI-BORING-SCRIPT: (Better Name -> Time_Calc.sh)
Basic Python Script for Extracting Data out of a .pdf file and calculating times per Item + Total time. ((WORK IN PROGRESS))

-> It reads Item Number + Item Name and accepts a list of build_times for differnt items and multiplies them.
