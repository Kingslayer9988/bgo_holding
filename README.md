# BGO HOLDING - WORK STUFF

‚ö†Ô∏è **I strongly advise anybody to not copy or clone this Repo.** ‚ö†Ô∏è  
I would wish to make this Repository private but I have no access to it at work.

There would be an easy fix: please somehow make these 3 programs accessible on Work-Devices:
- **VS-Code** [Developed by Microsoft, Free as in Price, there is an Open-source Client Version]
- **WSL (Windows-Subsystem-for-Linux)** [Developed by Microsoft + Linux which is of course OpenSource]
- **GitHub** [Godfather of Open-source Community]

## Profi-Tour
For Profi-Tour things, look in the documentation folder. Or Press **[HERE](Mitschrift.md#-vorraus-avisieren-vor-avisieren)

## NEEDS TO BE ADDED:
- Fix/Create Profi-Tour Documentation -> Make it useful for other Humans => Later: "https://github.com/Kingslayer9988/BGO_Guides"
- Script that re-names all Frachtbriefe & Tourenplan .PDF files in the correct way and pushes them to the right locations.
- Native-Windows-Contextmenu-Stuff for making lists of wrongly calculated things from "$HERSTELLER".
- Automations to "GREP" things from PDFs to make a list of items with their build times.
- Probably make everything work in Powershell or BATCH ü§¢ - People refusing me LINUX again üò¢

## WORKING: (Still needs adoption for "$Hersteller")
### ANTI-BORING-SCRIPT: (Better Name -> Time_Calc.sh)
Executes one of two basic Python scripts for extracting data out of a .pdf or a screenshot file and calculating times per item + total time.

- It reads item number + item name and accepts a list of build times for different items and multiplies them.

### Terminal Output:
