We have a Makro here that colors and calculate fractions for my Dispatcher-Plan

We have Upper Rows = Tours = Row 3 - 23
We have Downer Rows = Container = 35-38
We have Dates = Every Day = 3 Collums wide (Monday = B-D | Tue = E-G)

For the Downer Rows every Container has 2 Rows and 3 Colloums for every day
Monday Cont 1 (B35 - D36) matching Container number in (B)
Monday Cont 2 (B37- D38)
Max. 2 Container per Day!

for the Upper Rows(Tours) we have 3 rows and 3 Collums for each Tour per Day
Monday Tour 1 (B3 - D5) matching Container number in (D)
Monday Tour 7 (B21-D23)
Per day are Max of 7 Tours

the Makro calculates Fractions already correct and colors matching container in Tours and Container Fields accordingly.
